<!-- 2. Alternative Text for Images (alt attribute)

Why it matters: Screen readers can't interpret images. Alt text provides a textual description for users with visual impairments.
How to do it:
Always include the alt attribute within your <img> tags.
Be descriptive but concise. Convey the essence of the image and its purpose. -->
