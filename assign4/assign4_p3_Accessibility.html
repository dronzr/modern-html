<!-- What is Web Accessibility?

Web accessibility means designing and developing websites, tools, and technologies so that people with disabilities can fully use them. This includes people with:

Visual disabilities: Blindness, low vision, color blindness
Auditory disabilities: Deafness or hard of hearing
Motor disabilities: Difficulty or inability to use a mouse, limited fine motor control
Cognitive disabilities: Learning disabilities, difficulty focusing
Why is Accessibility Essential?

Ethical Responsibility: The web should be an inclusive space, providing equal access to information and services for everyone, regardless of ability.

Expanded Audience: Accessible websites can be used by a significantly wider range of people, increasing your potential reach.

Improved Usability: Accessibility principles often overlap with good design practices, resulting in a better user experience for everyone.

Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Properly structured and semantic HTML, a key part of accessibility, makes websites more understandable to search engines, improving rankings.

Legal Considerations: In many countries, there are legal requirements that mandate web accessibility for public or government-related websites.

How Accessibility Benefits Different User Groups

People with visual disabilities: Screen readers can read aloud content that is properly structured and has alternative text descriptions for images.
People with auditory disabilities: Captions or transcripts for videos provide crucial access to content.
People with motor disabilities: Websites designed for keyboard-only navigation allow full interaction without a mouse.
People with cognitive disabilities: Clear headings, simple language, and well-organized layouts aid in understanding content. -->

      <p>mportant Note:

        Web accessibility is a complex and multifaceted topic. Here are some key areas it encompasses:
        
        Semantic HTML (using <header>, <nav>, <main>, etc.)
        Image alt text
        Form labeling and structure
        Color contrast
        Keyboard navigation
        ARIA attributes (to enhance accessibility for assistive technologies)</p>
