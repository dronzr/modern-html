<!-- **What are HTML Entities?**

* HTML entities are text strings used to represent characters that either have a special meaning in HTML or cannot be easily typed on a standard keyboard.
* They always start with an ampersand (`&`) and end with a semicolon (`;`).

**5 Commonly Used HTML Entities**

1. **Less than (`<`)**:  `&lt;` 
   * Used to display the less-than symbol without breaking the HTML structure.

2. **Greater than (`>`)**: `&gt;`
   * Used to display the greater-than symbol without breaking the HTML structure.

3. **Ampersand (`&`)**: `&amp;` 
   * Used to display the ampersand symbol itself, as it has special meaning within HTML entities.

4. **Non-breaking space (` `)**: `&nbsp;`
   * Creates a space that prevents automatic line breaks in the text, useful for keeping phrases or values together.

5. **Copyright (`Â©`)**: `&copy;`
   *  Displays the copyright symbol. -->
